Purpose:

        To create a program that mimics a podcast network. Podcasts have a title and a host and a data structure for storing 0 or more Episodes. 
        Each episode will have some metadata and some content (in our examples the content consists of lorem ipsum gibberish). 
        Episodes may then be “played” (i.e., have their content printed to the console).
